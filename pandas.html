                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to south central China, easily recognized by its distinctive black patches around its eyes, ears, and body. Although a member of the order Carnivora, over 99% of its diet is bamboo. In captivity, they are sometimes fed honey, eggs, fish, and fruit.

They are found in mountain ranges in central China, mostly in Sichuan, and are considered a conservation-reliant endangered species.</p>
